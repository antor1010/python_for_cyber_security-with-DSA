# Python for Cyber Security with DSA

Welcome! This repository contains a curated collection of **Python programs** focused on **Basic Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Introductory Cyber Security concepts**.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

**Antor Biswas**  
3rd Year CSE (Cyber Security) Student at **IEM (Institute of Engineering & Management)** 📍  
I created this repository as part of my learning journey to practice Python, strengthen algorithm skills, and explore cyber security concepts.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

This repo includes Python scripts covering:

### 🧠 Python & DSA Basics
- Fundamental Python programs
- Data Structures like lists, strings, and dictionaries
- Algorithm examples: sorting, searching, recursion

### 🛡️ Cyber Security with Python (Beginner Level)
- Simple security utilities and scripts
- Cryptography basics
- Password handling and validation
- Tools to practice security concepts in Python

These examples help you **learn logic and problem-solving** using Python — useful for both coding and security contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
